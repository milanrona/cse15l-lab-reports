## Part 2

- For me presonally, the bash scipt was the most new and interesting. Never would have i thought that you can make repetivtive work that musch quicker. I found week 6 and 9's lab the most interesting since we had to create a bash script. While it is very useful it is challenging aswell for example where to put `space` for `if` statements. This topic seems very useful for the future.
