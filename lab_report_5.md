# Lab Report 5


## Part 1

Question:

![Image1](question1.png)

So my question is regarding of `solution.sh`. I have created 3 tester files with `.txt` extensions, all of them containing one Integer. Than i created 3 files with `.expected` extension. Test 1 and 2 are correct in the sense that `test1.expected` and `test2.expected` contain an intiger 1 larger than thier counterparts. It produces correct output for 3 test out of the 4, but when all 3 tests are present in the `test-files` it only outputs that 1 of them are correct (when it supposed to be 2).

## Part 2

- For me presonally, the bash scipt was the most new and interesting. Never would have i thought that you can make repetivtive work that musch quicker. I found week 6 and 9's lab the most interesting since we had to create a bash script. While it is very useful it is challenging aswell for example where to put `space` for `if` statements. This topic seems very useful for the future.
