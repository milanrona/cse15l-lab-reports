*The code is probably wrong somewhere, since when ran it, i was unable to start a server. It said the server started but it didn't give me a link for access*

# Part3

I learned a lot of new things about servers and remote access. My knowledge on the topic previously was close to nothing. I found it very intresting setting up web servers and using methods through them. The NumberServer was very intresting, I saw some real life aspect of coding. Running webservers and running methods from the quary and how you can control that through code was also new for me.
