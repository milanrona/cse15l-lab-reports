# Change Directory

1. Running command with *no* arguement
we are currently in the **home** directory.
Having *no* arguements meant that there was no change or output from the terminal.
We are currently still in the **home** directory as seen in the picture below.

2. Running command with a *path to a directory* as an arguement
We are currently in the **home** directory.
We imput this:

''' 
cd /home/lecture1/messages/
'''
we see that the present working directory *(pwd)* is messages rather than home.
This is not an error rather a **correct** way to change directory.

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a **file** as an arguement.
We are starting from the home directory again.
This time we are going to the *file en-us.txt*
We can an error in this instance, due to the fact that we are going to a **File** rather than a **Directory**.
Change directory can only switch to directories and in this case we are trying to change to a txt file.
